ðŸ§ª COVID-19 Clinical Trials â€“ EDA & Machine Learning

This project is a comprehensive data exploration and machine learning pipeline built on real-world COVID-19 clinical trial data.
It transforms raw trial records into insightful stories and predictions through stunning visualizations and robust ML models.

ðŸŒŸ Highlights

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with creative and eye-catching plots:

Donut Chart for trial status distribution

Treemap of top countries leading research

Word Cloud of medical conditions studied

Timeline of trial start dates

Heatmaps, Bubble charts, Ridge plots, Violin plots & more!

 Machine Learning Pipeline:

Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)

Random Forest Classifier to predict trial completion

Feature importance analysis with interactive Plotly charts

Stylish confusion matrix & performance metrics

 Unique Visual Storytelling:

Sunburst chart for Phases â†’ Status â†’ Gender

Sankey flow for Phases â†’ Status mapping

3D Scatter plots for Enrollment vs Age vs Phases

Polar & stacked bar charts for demographic insights

ðŸš€ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Data Viz: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, WordCloud

ML: Random Forest Classifier with balanced training

Interactive Dashboards: Plotly visualizations

ðŸŽ¯ What this project delivers

A research-ready pipeline for analyzing clinical trial datasets

A prediction model for trial completion outcomes

A visually rich data story that is both scientifically useful and presentation-ready

ðŸ“Œ Why itâ€™s unique

Unlike typical EDA projects, this repository focuses on visual impact + ML insights, turning complex trial data into engaging charts that impress researchers, data scientists, and non-technical audiences alike.

âœ¨ This project bridges the gap between medical research and data science by combining analytical depth with visual storytelling.
